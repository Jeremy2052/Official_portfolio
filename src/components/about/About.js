          I am a recent graduate at University of Texas at Arlington and currently hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science but continue to learn and work on projects to expand my knowledge on what I love to do with building applications. I have 2 years of experience in front-end developing with
          React and specialize in JavaScript but have familiar knowledge of Python and Java. Using my skills, I have developed personal projects such as ecommerce shopping websites as well as social media applications.
        </p>
        <p className="about-desc">
          I continue to build projects on my free time using React.js as the framework for the front-end and Node.js, Express and MongoDB for the back-end. I enjoy learning and progressing with the framework and the languages I use to become more skillful especially when there are challenges. I
          manage my free time to take online courses and tutorials to learn and improve on what I enjoy doing. I also enjoy working aside with others in teams and I am not afraid to ask questions or for help if needed in order to solve all problems.
